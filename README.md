# Awesome Sentiment Attitude Extraction

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

<p align="center">
    <img src="logo.png"/>
</p>

A curated list of awesome studes related to sentiment attitude extraction,
in which **attitude** corresponds to the *text position* 
conveyed by <u>Subject</u> towards other <u>Object</u>
mentioned in text such as: entities, events, etc.
 
This repository collects works both related to **relation extraction** and **sentiment analysis** 
in which these two domains are inextricably linked, including event factualization as fundamentional studies 
for sentiment inference, stance detection.
