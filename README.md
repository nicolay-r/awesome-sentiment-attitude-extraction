# Awesome Sentiment Attitude Extraction

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome studes related to sentiment attitude extraction,
in which **attitude** corresponds to the *text position* 
conveyed by <u>Subject</u> towards other <u>Object</u>
mentioned in text such as: entities, events, etc.
 
This repository collects works both related to **relation extraction** and **sentiment analysis** 
in which these two domains are inextricably linked, including event factualization as fundamentional studies 
for sentiment inference, stance detection.

## Frameworks

* **AREkit** [[github]](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit) [[research-applicable-paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13730.pdf)
    * Is an open-source and extensible toolkit focused on data preparation for 
    document-level relation extraction organization. 
     It complements the OpenNRE functionality, as in terms of the latter, 
     document-level RE setting is not widely explored (2.4 [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3029.pdf)). 
* **DeRE**
 [[github]](https://github.com/ims-tcl/DeRE) 
 [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D18-2008/)
     * Is an open-source framework for **de**claritive **r**elation **e**xtraction, and therefore allows to declare your own task (using XML schemas) and apply manually implemented models towards it (using a provided API).
* **OpenNRE**
 [[github]](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE) 
 [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3029.pdf)
    * Is an open-source and extensible toolkit that provides a unified framework to implement neural models for relation extraction (RE) between named entities
